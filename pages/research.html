    <h3>Person Perception</h3>
<p>Research in the lab focuses on the cognitive and neural representation of other people’s personality and mental states. In particular, I am interested in how people spontaneously infer personality traits from minimal social information and in using neuroimaging methods to uncover (i.e. decode) the content of these social inferences. His research is aimed at understanding how our knowledge of other people (their likes and dislikes, their personalities, their quirks and habits) is organized into a coherent impression and, in turn, how this impression is encoded in the brain. Using a combination of functional neuroimaging, machine learning techniques and popular media (e.g., films, television), research in his laboratory is working towards developing methods to gain access to how individuals think and feel about the people around them.</p>
<h3>Self Regulation Failure</h3>
<p>A seperate line of research consists of characterizing the brain systems involved in self-regulation and its failure. Borrowing techniques from experimental social psychology, we’ve shown that inducing self-regulatory failure by having people regulate in one-domain (e.g. cognitive) subsequently leads to disinhibited neural responses to stimuli in other domains (e.g. emotions, food cravings). A separate line of research in his laboratory is involved in understanding the interplay between motivation, self-control and desire in order to identify neural and behavioral predictors of self-regulation failure as well as to identify ways to bolster against everyday temptations.</p>
