<strong>Dylan D. Wagner, Ph.D.</strong> <br />
<em>Assistant Professor of Psychology</em><br />
<a href="mailto:wagner.1174@osu.edu">email</a> | <a href="http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/dwagner/">Faculty page</a> | <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r_6OnfwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">google scholar</a> | <a href="cv/cv_wagner.pdf">cv</a></p>
<p>Dylan Wagner joined the psychology faculty at The Ohio State University in the fall of 2014. He is also a member of the <a href="http://ccbbi.osu.edu/">Center for Cogntive and Behavioral Brain Imaging</a> and the <a href="https://cog.osu.edu/">Center for Cognitive and Behavioral Science</a>. He received his B.A. in Psychology from McGill University and his Ph.D. in Psychology from Dartmouth College with <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~thlab/">Todd Heatherton</a>. His post-doctoral research was conducted in collaboration with <a href="http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/">James Haxby</a> and Todd Heatherton. His research covers several topics related to person perception, social cognition, self-regulation and social neuroscience. Using a combination of functional neuroimaging, machine learning techniques and popular media (e.g., films, television), research in his laboratory is working towards developing methods to gain access to how individuals think and feel about the the people and temptations that surround them.</p>

<strong>Robert Chavez, Ph.D.</strong><br />
<a href="mailto:chavez.95@osu.edu">email</a> | <a href="http://robchavez.org/">Personal Website</a> | <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vHEQPGUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">google scholar</a> | <a href="cv/cv_chavez.pdf">cv</a></p>
<p>Robert Chavez graduated from Dartmouth College with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience in 2015. His research investigates how brain regions work together to represent information about the self, other people, and the ways in which these differ from one another. More specifically, I am interested in the structure and function of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). The MPFC has been implicated in myriad cognitive and affective processes, from memory and reward to social cognition and self-representation. However, the details of how this large, complex brain region encodes and integrates information to give rise to these processes remain poorly understood. My research aims to address these issues using multimodal neuroimaging and statistical learning approaches.</p>
<p>Outside of the lab, Robert is also interested in data science, evolutionary theory, craft beer, New Mexican food, the bass guitar, and any combination thereof.</p>
<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
<p><strong>Jonathan Stahl</strong><br />

<h3>Lab Manager</h3>
<p><strong>Allison Londerée</strong><br />
<a href="mailto:londeree.4@buckeyemail.osu.edu">email</a></p>
<p>Allison Londerée graduated with B.S. in Neuroscience with a minor in Integrative Approaches to Health and Wellness in 2015. She worked with Ruchika Prakash on her undergraduate thesis. Broadly, she seeks to analyze the impact of different lifestyle choices and perceptions on cognitive functioning using both behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods in healthy individuals and clinical populations.</p>
<p>Other than working in lab, Allison enjoys playing board games, hiking, and exploring vegetarian cuisine!</p>
